ReadBetter — Easy Reading for Dyslexia

Swift Student Challenge Submission

🌟 Overview

ReadBetter is an accessibility-first iOS app that helps children with dyslexia read words confidently using a calm, multi-sensory learning experience.

Built with SwiftUI as a Swift Playground, ReadBetter combines dyslexia-friendly typography, speech-based pronunciation practice, interactive stories, and OCR from real books to make reading clearer, slower, and more encouraging.

The app is 100% offline, privacy-first, and designed following Apple Human Interface Guidelines.
